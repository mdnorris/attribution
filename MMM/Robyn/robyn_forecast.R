Sys.setenv(R_FUTURE_FORK_ENABLE = TRUE) # Force multicore when using RStudio
options(future.fork.enable = TRUE)
df <- read.csv('tyson_robyn_mean.csv', fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM')

### Step 1.5: Data Planning
# names(df)[names(df) == "Date"] <- "DATE"
# df$DATE <- as.POSIXlt(df$DATE, "%Y-%m-%d", tz = "UTC", origin = "2019-09-30")
################################################################
#### Step 2a: For first time user: Model specification in 4 steps
#### 2a-1: First, specify input variables
InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(
  dt_input = df
  , dt_holidays = dt_prophet_holidays
  , date_var = "DATE" # date format must be "2020-01-01"
  , dep_var = "revenue" # there should be only one dependent variable
  , dep_var_type = "revenue" # "revenue" (ROI) or "conversion" (CPA)
  , prophet_vars = c("trend", "season", "holiday") # "trend","season", "holiday"
  , prophet_country = "US" # input one country of dt_prophet_holidays
  , context_vars = c("cag_V") # e.g. competitors, discount, unemployment etc
  , paid_media_spends = c("bloggers_S", "coupon_S", "display_S", 'radio_S')
  , paid_media_vars = c("bloggers_I", "coupon_I", "display_I", 'radio_I')
  # paid_media_vars are mandatory like paid_media_spends, and must have same order as
  # paid_media_spends. Use media exposure metrics like impressions,
  # GRP etc. If not applicable, use spend instead.
  , organic_vars = c('chicken') # marketing activity without media spend
  # ,factor_vars = ("incidents") # specify which variables in context_vars or
  # organic_vars are factorial
  # prophet pulls in your date range from the date variable, but the window start
  # and window end require you to put in dates that are in between and smaller
  # than your total dates
  , window_start = "2019-10-21"
  , window_end = "2021-05-02"
  , adstock = "weibull_pdf" # geometric, weibull_cdf or weibull_pdf.
)
print(InputCollect)

#### 2a-2: Second, define and add hyperparameters
## hyperparameter names needs to be base on paid_media_spends names. Run:
hyper_names(adstock = InputCollect$adstock, all_media = InputCollect$all_media)
plot_adstock(plot = TRUE)
plot_saturation(plot = TRUE)
hyper_limits()
## to see correct hyperparameter names. Check GitHub homepage for background of change.
## Also calibration_input are required to be spend names.
## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ##
## Guide to setup & understand hyperparameters

## 1. IMPORTANT: set plot = TRUE to see helper plots of hyperparameter's
# effect in transformation
# Write function here to pass through all the info
# 2. Get correct hyperparameter names:
# All variables in paid_media_spends and organic_vars require hyperparameter and will be
# transformed by adstock & saturation.

hyperparameters <- list(
  bloggers_S_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
  , bloggers_S_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
  , bloggers_S_scales = c(0, 0.1)
  , bloggers_S_shapes = c(2.0001, 10)
  
  , chicken_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
  , chicken_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
  , chicken_scales = c(0, 0.1)
  , chicken_shapes = c(2.0001, 10)
  
  , coupon_S_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
  , coupon_S_gammas = c(0.3, 1)

  , radio_S_scales = c(0, 0.1)
  , radio_S_shapes = c(2.0001, 10))

#### 2a-3: Third, add hyperparameters into robyn_inputs()
InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(InputCollect = InputCollect,
                             hyperparameters = hyperparameters)
print(InputCollect)
#### 2a-4: Fourth (optional), model calibration / add experimental input
## Guide for calibration source
# 1. We strongly recommend to use experimental and causal results that are considered
# ground truth to calibrate MMM. Usual experiment types are people-based (e.g. Facebook
# conversion lift) and geo-based (e.g. Facebook GeoLift).
# 2. Currently, Robyn only accepts point-estimate as calibration input. For example, if
# 10k$ spend is tested against a hold-out for channel A, then input the incremental
# return as point-estimate as the example below.
# 3. The point-estimate has to always match the spend in the variable. For example, if
# channel A usually has $100K weekly spend and the experimental holdout is 70%, input
# the point-estimate for the $30K, not the $70K.

#### Step 3: Build initial model

## Run all trials and iterations. Use ?robyn_run to check parameter definition
OutputModels <- robyn_run(
  InputCollect = InputCollect # feed in all model specification
  , cores = 16 # default ??? Data_Definitions tese functions
  #, add_penalty_factor = FALSE # Untested feature. Use with caution.
  , iterations = 2500 # try to increase to converge faster
  , trials = 6 # try to increase to converge faster
  , outputs = FALSE # outputs = FALSE disables direct model output
)
print(OutputModels)

## Check MOO (multi-objective optimization) convergence plots
OutputModels$convergence$moo_distrb_plot
OutputModels$convergence$moo_cloud_plot

## Calculate Pareto optimality, cluster and export results and plots. See ?robyn_outputs
OutputCollect <- robyn_outputs(
  InputCollect, OutputModels
  , pareto_fronts = 1
  , calibration_constraint = .1 #& default at 0.1
  , csv_out = "pareto" # "pareto" or "all"
  , clusters = TRUE # Set to TRUE to cluster similar models by ROAS. See ?robyn_clusters
  , plot_pareto = TRUE # Set to FALSE to deactivate plotting and saving model one-pagers
  , plot_folder = robyn_object # path for plots export
)
print(OutputCollect)

convergence <- robyn_converge(OutputModels)
convergence$moo_distrb_plot
convergence$moo_cloud_plot
print(OutputCollect)

##??? 4 csv files are exported into the folder for further usage. Check schema here:
## https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/schema.R
# pareto_hyperparameters.csv, hyperparameters per Pareto output model
# pareto_aggregated.csv, agg decomposition per independent variable of Pareto output
# pareto_media_transform_matrix.csv, all media transformation vectors
# pareto_alldecomp_matrix.csv, all decomposition vectors of independent variables
################################################################
#### Step 4: Select and save the initial model
## Compare all model one-pagers and select one that mostly reflects your business reality
print(OutputCollect)
select_model <- "2_136_5" # select one from above
ExportedModel <- robyn_save(
  robyn_object = robyn_object, # model object location and name
  select_model = select_model, # selected model ID
  InputCollect = InputCollect,
  OutputCollect = OutputCollect
)
print(ExportedModel)
plot(ExportedModel)
################################################################
## Step 5: Get budget allocation based on the selected model above
# Budget allocation result requires further validation. Please use this recommendation
# with caution.  Don't interpret budget allocation result if selected model above
# doesn't meet business expectation.
# Look at any and all suggestions to see if the recomendations make sense;
# On occasions, they suggest dropping spend on the holidays and even no ad spend
# Check media summary for selected model
print(ExportedModel)
# Run ?robyn_allocator to check parameter definition
# Run the "max_historical_response" scenario: "What's the revenue lift potential with the
# same historical spend level and what is the spend mix?"
AllocatorCollect1 <- robyn_allocator(
  InputCollect = InputCollect
  , OutputCollect = OutputCollect
  , select_model = select_model
  , scenario = "max_historical_response"
  , channel_constr_low = 0.7
  , channel_constr_up = c(1.2)
  , export = TRUE
  , date_min = "2019-12-08"
  , date_max = "2021-05-03"
)
print(AllocatorCollect1)
plot(AllocatorCollect1)

# Run the "max_response_expected_spend" scenario: "What's the maximum response for a given
# total spend based on historical saturation andthe spend mix?" "optmSpendShareUnit"
# is the optimum spend share.
AllocatorCollect2 <- robyn_allocator(
  InputCollect = InputCollect
  , OutputCollect = OutputCollect
  , select_model = select_model
  , scenario = "max_response_expected_spend"
  , channel_constr_low = c(0.7)
  , channel_constr_up = c(1.5)
  , expected_spend = 1000000 # Total spend to be simulated
  , expected_spend_days = 7 # Duration of expected_spend in days
  , export = TRUE
)
print(AllocatorCollect2)
AllocatorCollect2$dt_optimOut
plot(AllocatorCollect2)

## A csv is exported into the folder for further usage. Check schema here:
## https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/blob/main/demo/schema.R

## QA optimal response
# Pick any media variable: InputCollect$all_media
select_media <- "coupon_S"
# For paid_media_spends set metric_value as your optimal spend
metric_value <- AllocatorCollect1$dt_optimOut[channels == select_media, optmSpendUnit]
# # For paid_media_vars and organic_vars, manually pick a value
# metric_value <- 10000

if (TRUE) {
  optimal_response_allocator <- AllocatorCollect1$dt_optimOut[
    channels == select_media, optmResponseUnit]
  optimal_response <- robyn_response(
    robyn_object = robyn_object,
    select_build = 0,
    media_metric = select_media,
    metric_value = metric_value)
  plot(optimal_response$plot)
  if (length(optimal_response_allocator) > 0) {
    cat("QA if results from robyn_allocator and robyn_response agree: ")
    cat(round(optimal_response_allocator) == round(optimal_response$response), "( ")
    cat(optimal_response$response, "==", optimal_response_allocator, ")\n")
  }
}

################################################################
#### Step 6: Model refresh based on selected model and saved Robyn.RDS object - Alpha

## NOTE: must run robyn_save to select and save an  model first, before refreshing below
## The robyn_refresh() function is suitable for updating within "reasonable periods"
## Two situations are considered better to rebuild model:
## 1, most data is new. If  model has 100 weeks and 80 weeks new data is added in refresh,
## it might be better to rebuild the model
## 2, new variables are added

# Run ?robyn_refresh to check parameter definition
Robyn <- robyn_refresh(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  , dt_input = df
  , dt_holidays = dt_prophet_holidays
  , refresh_steps = 4
  , refresh_mode = "manual"
  , refresh_iters = 1000 # 1k is estimation. Use refresh_mode = "manual" to try out.
  , refresh_trials = 3
  , plot_pareto = TRUE
  , clusters = FALSE
)

## Besides plots: there're 4 csv output saved in the folder for further usage
# report_hyperparameters.csv, hyperparameters of all selected model for reporting
# report_aggregated.csv, aggregated decomposition per independent variable
# report_media_transform_matrix.csv, all media transformation vectors
# report_alldecomp_matrix.csv,all decomposition vectors of independent variables

# Export this refreshed model you wish to export
last_refresh_num <- sum(grepl('listRefresh', names(Robyn))) + 1 # Pick any refresh.
# Here's the final refresh using the model recommended by least combined normalized nrmse
# and decomp.rssd
ExportedRefreshModel <- robyn_save(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  , select_model = Robyn[[last_refresh_num]]$OutputCollect$selectID
  , InputCollect = Robyn[[last_refresh_num]]$InputCollect
  , OutputCollect = Robyn[[last_refresh_num]]$OutputCollect
)

################################################################
#### Step 7: Get budget allocation recommendation based on selected refresh runs

# Run ?robyn_allocator to check parameter definition
AllocatorCollect <- robyn_allocator(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  #, select_build = 1 # Use third refresh model
  , scenario = "max_response_expected_spend"
  , channel_constr_low = c(0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7)
  , channel_constr_up = c(1.2, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5)
  , expected_spend = 2000000 # Total spend to be simulated
  , expected_spend_days = 14 # Duration of expected_spend in days
)
print(AllocatorCollect)
plot(AllocatorCollect)

################################################################
#### Step 8: get marginal returns

###??? Can take hours to run

## how to get marginal ROI of next 1000$ from the 80k spend level for search channel

# Run ?robyn_response to check parameter definition

## -------------------------------- NOTE v3.6.0 CHANGE !!! --------------------------- ##
## The robyn_response() function can now output response for spends and exposures (imps,
## GRP, circular_S sendings etc.) as well as plotting individual saturation curves. New
## argument names "media_metric" and "metric_value" instead "paid_media_var" and "spend"
## are now used to accommodate this change. Also the returned output is a list now and
## contains also the plot.
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------##

# Get response for 80k from result saved in robyn_object
Spend1 <- 60000
Response1 <- robyn_response(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  #, select_build = 1 # 2 means the second refresh model. 0 means the initial model
  , media_metric = "display_S"
  , metric_value = Spend1)
Response1$response / Spend1 # ROI for search 80k
Response1$plot

# Get response for 81k
Spend2 <- Spend1 + 1000
Response2 <- robyn_response(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  #, select_build = 1
  , media_metric = "influence_S"
  , metric_value = Spend2)
Response2$response / Spend2 # ROI for search 81k
Response2$plot

# Marginal ROI of next 1000$ from 80k spend level for search
(Response2$response - Response1$response) / (Spend2 - Spend1)

## Example of getting paid media exposure response curves
imps <- 50000000
response_imps <- robyn_response(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  #, select_build = 1
  , media_metric = "app_S"
  , metric_value = imps)
response_imps$response / imps * 1000
response_imps$plot

## Example of getting organic media exposure response curves
sendings <- 30000
response_sending <- robyn_response(
  robyn_object = robyn_object
  #, select_build = 1
  , media_metric = "circular_S"
  , metric_value = sendings)
response_sending$response / sendings * 1000
response_sending$plot

################################################################
#### Optional: get old model results

# Get old hyperparameters and select model
# dt_hyper_fixed <-
# data.table::fread("~/Desktop/2022-03-31 12.32 rf4/pareto_hyperparameters.csv")
# select_model <- "1_25_9"
# dt_hyper_fixed <- dt_hyper_fixed[solID == select_model]

# OutputCollectFixed <- robyn_run(
# InputCollect must be provided by robyn_inputs with same data and parameters as before
#   InputCollect = InputCollect
#   , plot_folder = robyn_object
#   , dt_hyper_fixed = dt_hyper_fixed)
#
# # Save Robyn object for further refresh
# robyn_save(robyn_object = robyn_object
#            , select_model = select_model
#            , InputCollect = InputCollect
#            , OutputCollect = OutputCollectFixed)

# Glossary
## 3. Hyperparameter interpretation & recommendation:

## Geometric adstock: Theta is the only parameter and means fixed decay rate. Assuming TV
## spend on day 1 is 100€ and theta = 0.7, then day 2 has 100*0.7=70€ worth of effect
## carried-over from day 1, day 3 has 70*0.7=49€ from day 2 etc. Rule-of-thumb for common
## media genre: TV c(0.3, 0.8), OOH/Print/Radio c(0.1, 0.4), digital c(0, 0.3)

# Weibull CDF adstock: The Cumulative Distribution Function of Weibull has two parameters
# , shape & scale, and has flexible decay rate, compared to Geometric adstock with fixed
# decay rate. The shape parameter controls the shape of the decay curve. Recommended
# bound is c(0.0001, 2). The larger the shape, the more S-shape. The smaller, the more
# L-shape. Scale controls the inflexion point of the decay curve. We recommend very
# conservative bounce of c(0, 0.1), because scale increases the adstock half-life greatly.

# Weibull PDF adstock: The Probability Density Function of the Weibull also has two
# parameters, shape & scale, and also has flexible decay rate as Weibull CDF. The
# difference is that Weibull PDF offers lagged effect. When shape > 2, the curve peaks
# after x = 0 and has NULL slope at x = 0, enabling lagged effect and sharper increase and
# decrease of adstock, while the scale parameter indicates the limit of the relative
# position of the peak at x axis; when 1 < shape < 2, the curve peaks after x = 0 and has
# infinite positive slope at x=0, enabling lagged effect and slower increase and decrease
# of adstock, while scale has the same effect as above; when shape = 1, the curve peaks at
# x = 0 and reduces to exponential decay, while scale controls the inflexion point; when
# 0 < shape < 1, the curve peaks at x = 0 and has increasing decay, while scale controls
# the inflexion point. When all possible shapes are relevant, we recommend c(0.0001, 10)
# as bounds for shape; when only strong lagged effect is of interest, we recommend
# c(2.0001, 10) as bound for shape. In all cases, we recommend conservative bound of
# c(0, 0.1) for scale. Due to the great flexibility of Weibull PDF, meaning more freedom
# in hyperparameter spaces for Nevergrad to explore, it also requires larger iterations
# to converge.

# Hill function for saturation: Hill function is a two-parametric function in Robyn with
# alpha and gamma. Alpha controls the shape of the curve between exponential and s-shape.
# Recommended bound is c(0.5, 3). The larger the alpha, the more S-shape. The smaller, the
# more C-shape. Gamma controls the inflexion point. Recommended bounce is c(0.3, 1). The
# larger the gamma, the later the inflection point in the response curve.

## 4. Set individual hyperparameter bounds. They either contain two values e.g. c(0, 0.5),
# or only one value, in which case you'd "fix" that hyperparameter.
